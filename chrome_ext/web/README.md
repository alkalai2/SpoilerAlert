SpoilerAlert
============

<p> SpoilerAlert is a Chrome extension and web application that removes spoilers from a user's Twitter and Facebook feeds.The application prompts users for Television shows they watch or Sports teams they follow - posts related to their interests are then blocked.
</p>
<p>
The application uses an algorithm to accumulate targets related to certain 'packages' a user inputs.The user can also add their own 'terms', which themselves will be targets for the application to use.
</p> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Packages</b> : Sets of targets related to TV shows or Sports teams <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Terms </b>: Individual words that become targets <br>

<p>SpoilerAlert uses its accumulated bank of targets to block content (posts, statuses, photos, comments)that mention the target(s). Blocked posts will contain a CSS blurred and color filter to make the content illegible. The post can then be revealed with a long-hover or click.
