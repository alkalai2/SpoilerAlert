DESCRIPTION: SpoilerAlert is a Google Chrome Extension that blocks potential tv show and sport spoilers from Facebook newsfeeds. Users enter shows and sports teams that they follow into a simple extension or website. Afterwards, when a reference to an entered term is found on Facebook, the app will blur the post, explain why the blocking occurred, and an option to remove the blocking.
